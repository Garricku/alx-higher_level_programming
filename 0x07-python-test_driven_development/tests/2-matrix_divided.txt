def matrix_divided(matrix, div):
    """
    Divides all elements of a matrix by a given number.

    Args:
        matrix (list): A list of lists of integers or floats.
        div (int or float): The number to divide the elements of the matrix by.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If matrix is not a list of lists of integers or floats, or if div is not an integer or float.
        ValueError: If each row of the matrix does not have the same size.
        ZeroDivisionError: If div is equal to 0.

    Returns:
        A new matrix with all elements divided by div, rounded to 2 decimal places.

    >>> matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    >>> div = 2
    >>> result = matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    >>> print(result)
    [[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0]]

    >>> matrix = [[1.5, -2], [-3.75, 4]]
    >>> div = -1.5
    >>> result = matrix_divided(matrix, div)
    >>> print(result)
    [[-1.0, 1.33], [2.5, -2.67]]

    >>> matrix = [[1], [2], [3]]

    >>> matrix = [[1], [2], "a"]
